  <h1>Suicidal Ideation and the Path to Salvation</h1>
  <p class="author">by Marshall Harris Myerson</p>
  
  <p>I didn’t write this for pity.</p>
  <p>Fuck no, Joe.</p>
  <p>I wrote it because I survived something that nearly killed me — and someone out there is dancing on the same goddamn edge, hangin’ ten on the worst wave of their life feeling like they’re aboutta wipe out.</p>
  <p>I’m as serious as I am sober. I want you to hear this — not from a shrink or a YouTube guru, but from your old pal Marshall. One stubborn bastard who’s been face down in the gravel, screaming (I mean SCREAMING) while the world just spun on.</p>
  <p>Yeah — I’ve had suicidal thoughts. Not once. Not twice. Many. Goddamn. Times…And not just the “what’s it all for?” kind. I’m talking the real McCoy, partner. Full-blown demon-bargaining, naming every devil in the book and staring ’em all down.</p>
  <p>I said: Fuck you. You tell me to jump — I stay put just to spite you.</p>
  <p>The darkness shifts. Sometimes it creeps like slow poison, other times it smacks you like a George Foreman haymaker. Sometimes it’s numbness. Bonanza’s on but I can’t look Ben Cartwright in the eye and tell him I can’t do it today. Sometimes it’s walking the Bowery of my mind, getting jumped by the leather-jacketed “punk of life” with a mental switchblade.</p>
  <p>You get cut. You stitch up. You learn the route.</p>
  <p>I drank. I drugged. I fought with my fists instead of with my mind. I got my ass kicked. I spiraled. And yeah, sometimes I wanted to disappear. But I didn’t. Because fuck that.</p>
  <p>Here’s the big middle finger to the voice that told me I was worthless: I’m still here you sicko! Not just breathing — building. Raging for my life, not against it. Taking care of my body.</p>
  <p>And for the first time in a long time — I’m proud. There was no “aha!” moment. No magic pill. It was, and is, a choice. To stay. To ask for help. To say: “Who do I want to be?” — and claw my way toward that man.</p>
  <p>And guess what, buck? Things. Fucking. Changed. The path wasn’t clean. It bled. But it worked.</p>
  <p>To be abundantly clear, my path looked like:</p>
  <p><ul><li>Getting sober when I thought that meant never having fun again.</li><li>Flushing the dope, and fuckin meaning it.</li><li>Walking my dog instead of vanishing.</li><li>Screaming Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, Gwar — 2AM therapy sessions where the pillow-turned-pulp didn’t stand a chance.</li><li>Writing like my life depended on it (because it did, and it does).</li><li>Blocking toxic people without apology. “Why’d you block me, Marshall?” Because I don’t hang out with dope addicts and any other clans of thieves that rob me of my peace.</li><li>Asking for help. It is not weakness.</li></ul></p>
  <p>You don’t need to save the world today. Just don’t disappear from it, and if you’re holding something — a bottle, a weapon, a thought — ready to ruin you… do what I did.</p>
  <p>Say: “Get fucked, you mongrel son of a bitch” to the demons. Then turn around and walk towards the light. One step at a time. You can lean on me. I mean that. I’m here. I stayed. And if you can’t believe in yourself today — believe in me, believing in you. That flame burns for you. Like Blue Öyster Cult, “I’m burnin’ I’m burnin’ I’m burnin’ for youuuuuuu.” I mean it.</p>
  <p>This is Marshall Harris Myerson.</p>
  <p>Still here. Still weird. Still proud. Still swinging…For the fences like Sammy fucking Sosa in this ballgame called life.</p>
